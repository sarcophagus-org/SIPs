# SIPs
Sarcophagus Improvement Proposals

Language and structure inspired (borrowed) from Synthietix SIP system

SIPs are used for improvements to the sarcophagus project. They can be used for anything from simple front end improvements to core protocol changes. Many changes will require a DAO vote to complete, but the SIP process here on Github is where the discussion will take place as well as where all of the code will be published. 

SIPs will also be used for bounties and grants via the gitcoin platform. All Gitcoin bounties will first start as issues.

## SIP Assets
SIPs should be written in markdown format. Image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that SIP as follows: assets/sip-X (for sip X). When linking to an image in the SIP, use relative links such as ../assets/sip-X/image.png.
